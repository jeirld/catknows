        <h1>Cat Care</h1>
        <p>Cat care is important because it ensures the health, well-being, and happiness of your pet. Proper care, including regular veterinary checkups, a balanced diet, mental and physical stimulation, and grooming, helps prevent health problems, increases their lifespan, and improves their quality of life. Additionally, well-cared-for cats are less likely to develop behavioral issues, ensuring a positive relationship between the cat and its owner.</p>

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <img class = "carepic" src = "images/cat nutrition.jpg" alt = "cat nutrition"/>
            <p>Proper nutrition is essential for cat care, as cats are obligate carnivores that need a diet rich in animal-based proteins, healthy fats, and essential nutrients like taurine for heart and vision health. A balanced diet, including vitamins and minerals, supports their overall well-being. To ensure your cat stays hydrated, provide fresh water and consider adding wet food to their diet. Tips for cat nutrition include choosing high-quality cat food with real meat as the primary ingredient, practicing portion control to prevent obesity, and consulting your vet for specific dietary needs based on your cat's age, health, and activity level.</p>

            <img class = "carepic" src = "images/cat health.jpeg" alt = "cat health"/>
            <p>Maintaining a cat's health is a key part of responsible cat care. Regular veterinary checkups are important to monitor their overall well-being, ensure they're up to date on vaccinations, and detect any potential health issues early. Dental care is often overlooked, but it's essential for preventing gum disease and other oral problems. Parasite prevention, such as flea, tick, and worm treatments, also protects cats from common infestations that can lead to serious health complications.</p>
            <img class = "carepichidden" src = "images/cat health 2.png" alt = "cat health"/>
            <p class = "tabletdesktoponly">In addition to regular vet visits, it's important to watch for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, behavior, or litter box habits, and seek veterinary care promptly if something seems off. A clean environment, proper nutrition, and regular grooming help maintain their physical health, while mental and physical stimulation through play and interaction prevent stress and boredom. Keeping up with these health practices ensures your cat enjoys a longer, happier life.</p>

            <h2>Grooming</h2>
            <img class = "carepic" src = "images/cat grooming.png" alt = "cat grooming"/>
            <p>Cat grooming is essential for maintaining a cat's health and appearance. Regular brushing helps reduce shedding, prevent matting, and minimize hairballs. It also allows you to check for skin issues, fleas, or ticks. Long-haired cats may need daily grooming, while short-haired cats can be brushed a few times a week. Additionally, trimming a cat's nails, cleaning their ears, and gently wiping their eyes can improve hygiene. Make grooming a positive experience by starting slowly, using gentle tools, and rewarding your cat with treats to help them stay calm during the process.</p>

            <img class = "carepic" src = "images/cat environment.jpg" alt = "cat environment"/>
            <p>Creating a safe and stimulating environment is vital for a cat's well-being. Ensure their surroundings are free from hazards like toxic plants and small objects, and provide cozy spaces with comfortable bedding and quiet areas for retreat. Regularly clean their litter box, food bowls, and sleeping areas to maintain hygiene. To prevent boredom and promote good behavior, offer scratching posts, climbing trees, and interactive toys to satisfy their natural instincts. Access to windows or safe outdoor spaces also enriches their environment, keeping them happy and engaged.</p>
